# Stock
In this model I have make a model predicting Stock price of Reliance using Random Forest Regression. 
At first I take data from Last one year data for training purpose.  then I have used The data for last few months for testing purpose . 
## I found that the model is quit effecient in predicting the stock prices. Although the stock prices in real cannot predicted using this method but for a beginner this project can motivate him to look for more possibility of Machine Learning in Finance . Next I will try to use Nueral networl to build a model that can predict stock prices.
